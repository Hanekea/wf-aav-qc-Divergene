# AAV QC workflow

This repository contains a [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) workflow
for use in the quality control of Adeno-associated virus (AAV) preps. 
Features of this workflow include:

* Masking of variable ITR regions
* Alignment of reads
* ITR-ITR region coverage
* Detection of contaminants
* Detection of truncation hotspots
* Categorisation of reads by AAV genome type
* Transgene plasmid reference consensus sequence generation
