# AAV QC workflow

This repository contains a [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) workflow
for use in the quality control of Adeno-associated virus (AAV) preps. 
Features of this workflow inlude:

* Generation of transgene reference orientations (flip/flop orientations)
* Alignment of reads
* ITR-ITR region coverage
* Detection of contaminants
* Detection of truncation hotspots
* Categorisation of reads by genome type
* Transgene reference consensus sequence generation
